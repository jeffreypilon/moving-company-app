section called "Moving To" (bold text) with the following form fields:

calendar date picker labeled "Move Date" that saves the move date selected in the calendar date picker

Select Service (dropdown containing titles of services in database) with the service id as the key value so that the quote may be associated with a service 

Submit and Reset buttons

Use the same type of form field validation and reset button functionality as the Sign Up component.

When the user clicks the submit button, if validation passes, a new Quote record should be inserted in the database containing data from all of the form fields above, as well as a unique id for the quote and also a field with the user id who created the quote so that the quote may be associated with a user.
