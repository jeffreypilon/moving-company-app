Your task is to "onboard" this repository to Copilot coding agent by adding a .github/copilot-instructions.md file in the repository that contains information describing how a coding agent seeing it for the first time can work most efficiently.

You will do this task only one time per repository and doing a good job can SIGNIFICANTLY improve the quality of the agent's work, so take your time, think carefully, and search thoroughly before writing the instructions.

<Goals>
- Reduce the likelihood of a coding agent pull request getting rejected by the user due to
generating code that fails the continuous integration build, fails a validation pipeline, or
having misbehavior.
- Minimize bash command and build failures.
- Allow the agent to complete its task more quickly by minimizing the need for exploration using grep, find, str_replace_editor, and code search tools.
</Goals>

<Limitations>
- Instructions must be no longer than 4 pages.
- Instructions must not be task specific.
</Limitations>

-The objective of this project is to To create an online application for a moving company using MERN stack technology and Mongoose: 
1. M:  MongoDB for the database
2. E:  Express.js is a back-end web application framework of NodeJS used for building RESTful APIs for back-end services
3. R:  React with Vite for the front-end user interface components, and React Router for handling routing in React applications
4. N:  Node.js for the back-end.  Back-end routes should also be used to map the RESTful API service calls
5. Mongoose: Mongoose is a JavaScript based object-oriented third-party library forMongoDB. It is used to create the connection between MongoDB and NodeJS runtime environment.

In this project we will develop and deploy an efficient and user-friendly online application for a moving company and its customers. A moving company notices that there has been a gradual decline in the number of leads or inquiries in the last three quarters. As a response to this declining demand, they decide to take their business online.  They want a web application that can handle all the inquiries and bookings for prospective customers, and want to provide customer moving quotes based on the details provided by the customers regarding the scope of the move and whether it will include packing services to pack the personal belongings of customers.  The application enables users to submit inquiries, receive quotations based on provided move details (including number and type of rooms to move, example number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house, apartment, etc) and seamlessly book moving services for customers.

Features:
- Admin should be able to define the geographical area where the moving company can be booked.
- Admin should be able to view and maintain all the customer details.
- Customers should be able to book the moving service online through the application
- Customers should be able to see the areas where the cabs are available.
- The user interface should be flexible and have the ability to be displayed on various devices, including computer monitors, iPads, and smart phone browsers.

Add information about how to build and validate changes so the agent does not need to search and find it each time.
<BuildInstructions>

- For each of bootstrap, build, test, run, lint, and any other scripted step, document the sequence of steps to take to run it successfully as well as the versions of any runtime or build tools used.
- Each command should be validated by running it to ensure that it works correctly as well as any preconditions and postconditions.
- Try cleaning the repo and environment and running commands in different orders and document errors and misbehavior observed as well as any steps used to mitigate the problem.
- Run the tests and document the order of steps required to run the tests.
- Make a change to the codebase. Document any unexpected build issues as well as the workarounds.
- Document environment setup steps that seem optional but that you have validated are actually required.
- Document the time required for commands that failed due to timing out.
- When you find a sequence of commands that work for a particular purpose, document them in detail.
- Use language to indicate when something should always be done. For example: "always run npm install before building".
- Record any validation steps from documentation.
</BuildInstructions>

<ProjectLayout>

- Please refer to coding-standards.md for layout and architecture of the codebase
- A description of the major architectural elements of the project, including the relative paths to the main project files, the location
of configuration files for linting, compilation, testing, and preferences.
- A description of the checks run prior to check in, including any GitHub workflows, continuous integration builds, or other validation pipelines.
- Document the steps so that the agent can replicate these itself.
- Any explicit validation steps that the agent can consider to have further confidence in its changes.
- Dependencies that aren't obvious from the layout or file structure.
- Finally, fill in any remaining space with detailed lists of the following, in order of priority: the list of files in the repo root, the
contents of the README, the contents of any key source files, the list of files in the next level down of directories, giving priority to the more structurally important and snippets of code from key source files, such as the one containing the main method.

<StepsToFollow>
- Perform a comprehensive inventory of the codebase. Search for and view:
- README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, coding-standards.md and all other documentation files.
- Search the codebase for build steps and indications of workarounds like 'HACK', 'TODO', etc.
- All scripts, particularly those pertaining to build and repo or environment setup.
- All build and actions pipelines.
- All project files.
- All configuration and linting files.
- For each file:
- think: are the contents or the existence of the file information that the coding agent will need to implement, build, test, validate, or demo a code change?
- If yes:
   - Document the command or information in detail.
   - Explicitly indicate which commands work and which do not and the order in which commands should be run.
   - Document any errors encountered as well as the steps taken to workaround them.
- Document any other steps or information that the agent can use to reduce time spent exploring or trying and failing to run bash commands.
- Finally, explicitly instruct the agent to trust the instructions and only perform a search if the information in the instructions is incomplete or found to be in error.
</StepsToFollow>
   - Document any errors encountered as well as the steps taken to work-around them.
